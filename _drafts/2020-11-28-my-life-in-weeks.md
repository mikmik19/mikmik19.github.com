We're nearing the end of the year which is always a time of reflection for me. I recently re-read the [Your Life in Weeks](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) blogpost over at [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and decided that now would be a good time to try that tool for self-reflection.

What I like about this approach is that it give you a single figure to stare at while you think about how you've spent your time. The blogpost describes how you should think of each week as a precious gem, but one qoute in particular caught my attention:

> Everyone you know, everyone you admire, every hero in history—they did it all with that same grid of empty boxes.

Those heroes may have had very different resources and circumsatances, but in the number of weeks are the same. So let's see how I've spent thouse preciouse gem weeks:

Some observations.

* I've still spent more time in school (~17 years) than I have at work (~7) -- this is true even if you count the Ph.D as a job which you should. So 10 years from now, when I turn 41 I will start to have spent more time at work, assuming I don't go back to school.
* All my time spent in school and at work is still less than the time I might spent in retirement if I retire at 67 and live to be 90. The retirement age will almost certainly be higher at the time of my retirement, but it doesn't change the observation much. Planning for retirement is probably a good idea.
* I have practically my whole careere ahead of me.
