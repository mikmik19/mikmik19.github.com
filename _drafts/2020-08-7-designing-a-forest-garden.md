When I eventually buy a house with a garden I want to establish a forest garden. Here I design the garden.

I got introduced to the concept of a forest garden when reading about permaculture. Permaculture is a design system.

> If we could create an ecosystem like the forest, but an edible one, we could do without all that oil. That is the basic idea of permaculture: creating edible ecosystems.

A forest garden mimics nature by being using a layered structure.

> One of the best examples of a permaculture garden is the forest garden developed by the late Robert Hart of Shropshire. It has the layered structure of a natural forest: a canopy of fruit trees, a lower layer of dwarf fruit trees and nut bushes, a shrub layer of soft fruit, a layer of perennial herbs and vegetables at ground level, plus root vegetables and climbers.

One of the things that caught my attention is the amount of thought that one needs to put into the design of the garden. I'm the kind of person who loves theorycrafting in videogames -- running the numbers to find optimal or interesting ways of playing -- and forest gardening seems to have a lot of theorycrafting potential.

> What makes the forest so productive and so self-reliant is its diversity. It is not so much the number of species that is important, but the number of useful connections between them. [...] Useful connections can only be made between things if they are put in the right place relative to each other. So permaculture is first and foremost a design system.

The fact that forest gardens are also a very space efficient way of producing food is a nice bonus because I don't expect that I will ever own a large piece of land. I would like to remain not too far from Copenhagen, so 600-1000m2 area is the most I can hope fore -- and that includes the house.

## Goals

My forest garden should meet the following citeria:
1. **Produce food all year round**. There should be something to harvest each year of the month. This will keep my engagement with the garden high.
1. **Use native species**. 
1. **Extend my culinary skills**. I want the garden to include things that I don't normally eat. It should give me an oppotunity to explore new dishes and snacks.
