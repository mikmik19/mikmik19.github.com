# About

I am Mikkel Hansen, an experience Data Scientist. I have a strong background in mathematics and physics.

# Work Experience


## Vital Beats
4 years

I focused on understanding our data and finding problems that could be meaningfully addressed using data science and machine learning. I help set the direction of Vital Beats' Data Science efforts while remaining hands-on.

- Grew the Data Science team from 1 to 5 employees.
- Assisted in attracting soft funding and investments. 
- Developed algorithm to predict severe cardiac arrhythmia for cardiac device patients.
- Developed algorithms to characterise ECG data and suggest medical diagnoses.
- Set up system for reproducible research based on Jupiter Notebook and internal Python Modules.
- Conduct user studies of arrhythmia prediction at the hospital.
- Set up a Data Warehouse on a Windows machine.

### Head of Data Science 
Mar 2019 - Mar 2021 (2 years)

### Data Scientist
Apr 2017 - Mar 2019 (2 years)



## Roskilde University and Laboratoire Léon Brillouin
3 years
I studied the structure and dynamics of hydrogen-bonded liquids using a variety of different experimental techniques. The focus was on understanding the dynamics of supra-molecular clusters in a large range of temperatures, including how the dynamics influence the crystallization process.

- Presentation.
